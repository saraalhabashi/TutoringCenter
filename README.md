The Tutoring System is a web-based application that is aimed towards the students at Prince Sultan University to help students connect with tutors fast. The Tutoring System targets all of the students of Prince Sultan University College of Women. When students want to get a tutor, they have to go all the way to the main building of the college to visit the studentsâ€™ affairs office and write their names down on a list. The process is taken care of manually by the teacher at the office, who looks over both the list of names of students who want to be tutors and the list of students who want a tutor. She then categorizes these students in terms of the courses they need or are willing to teach, and finally, she matches the tutor and student according to schedule. The Tutoring System should make this all so much simpler by getting it done at a much faster pace through the application.
